📌 About This Project

In this project, I combined multiple datasets available in different formats (CSV, JSON, and SQL) into a single final dataset.
This final dataset is then used to perform data analysis and answer all hackathon questions.

The main goal of this project is to understand data integration, joining datasets, and analyzing business insights from food delivery data.
